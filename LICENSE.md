# License FAQ

Please see the [Business Source License FAQ](https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-adopting/) for a general FAQ about the BSL.

## What is the motivation for using the BSL?

In recent years there have been multiple cases where large companies have created hosted SaaS versions of popular open
source projects and competed directly with similar offerings provided by the creators of the open source project. We believe
that open source creators should be able to monetise their offerings without fear of being undermined by large organisations
who can use their economies of scale to provide competing offerings, and often do not contribute back to the open source
communities.

## Who else uses the BSL?

Some well known products/companies that use BSL include:

* CockroachDB
* RedPanda
* ElasticSearch
* MariaDB
* Sentry
* Couchbase
* HashiCorp (Terraform, Vagrant etc)

## Can I host Tektite as a service for internal use in my company / organisation ?

Yes, as long as it is only used by your employees and/or contractors. You won't be able to expose the service outside your
company / organisation without a commercial licence from SpiritSoft.

## Can I use Tektite as part of my product that is only used internally in my company / organisation?

Yes, you can.

## Can I use Tektite as part of my own product or hosted service that is exposed to the general public?

Yes, as long as your service is not an "event streaming or processing platform". An "event streaming or processing platform"
allows third parties to perform actions that result in the creation of streams or topics in Tektite.

For example, if you were creating a financial SaaS offering and used Tektite internally, that would be fine. 

(Please see licensed text for the exact wording)

## How does the Tektite BSL License differ from a permissive open source license.

The Tektite BSL allows use similar to most permissive open source licenses with the added restriction that you cannot
use it to create an "event streaming or processing" platform product or service which is exposed outside your company /
organisation without a commercial licence.
